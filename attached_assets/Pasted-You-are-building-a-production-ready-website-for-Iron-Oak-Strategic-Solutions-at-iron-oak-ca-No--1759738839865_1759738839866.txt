You are building a production-ready website for “Iron & Oak Strategic Solutions” at iron-oak.ca. No placeholders. No lorem. All pages ship complete with final copy below. The app must prompt the operator on first run for contact details, save them to /config/site.json, and use that across the site.

TECH
- Next.js 14 App Router + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + lucide-react
- File-based content in /content/services as MDX with frontmatter
- Simple writeable API routes that persist JSON to /config and /data on Replit filesystem
- next-seo for SEO

FIRST-RUN SETUP (no placeholders)
- On npm run dev: run a small CLI wizard (node script in /scripts/setup.ts) that asks:
  - Company display name
  - Domain (iron-oak.ca)
  - Contact email
  - Phone
  - Mailing address (single line)
  - City, Region, Country
  - Booking link (Calendly or similar; if none, accept blank and omit the button)
- Save answers to /config/site.json. All pages read from this file.
- Add an /admin/setup route that re-opens the same form to edit values and re-save /config/site.json.
- Validate fields, show clear success toasts. No authentication needed for this prototype, but hide route from nav.

LEAD CAPTURE (fully functional, no placeholders)
- /api/contact: POST writes to /data/leads.json as an array with timestamp, ip (if available), name, email, org, message.
- Contact page form uses this API, shows success state. Add a /admin/leads page that lists leads in a simple table and offers “Download CSV” button that generates /data/leads.csv on click and serves it.

GLOBAL STYLE
- Dark, minimal, confident. Near-black bg, neutral greys, emerald accents.
- Rounded-2xl cards, soft shadows, real spacing. Inter font or equivalent.

NAV
- Home, About, Services, Contact, Book a Strategy Call (hide if no booking link in site.json)
